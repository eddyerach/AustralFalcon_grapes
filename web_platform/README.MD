# Austral Falcon: Web Platform
Austral Falcon is a technological solution designed to digitize processes that are currently performed manually in the agricultural industry. The platform uses Machine Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning technology to optimize decision making based on quantitative information, acquired systematically and with high precision. Has an innovative interface that displays all the variables and data collected in the crops, such as bunch weight, harvest quantity or weather conditions in the field.

## Our Platform
**Login**

Need to have an account for this you must use your email and password.

**General Information**

Next, there is a section where you will find all the general information i.e. the number of quarters, the area, the type of strain and the amount in tons per hectare being planted, about the fields you have associated to our platform.

**Create a New Field**

In addition, you can add a new field by selecting the area in which you want to farm. You must add a name to your new field, upload a file (.KMZ) with map locations and coordinates.

**Edit Quadrant**

Also, you will be able to edit your field by adding the most relevant data of your crop.

## Collect data: Weight of bunches, the amount of the crop or the climatic conditions of the field.

Through this application, the user can visualize the calculations made by the Artificial Intelligence for crop estimation and filter the results by different fields to obtain the information quickly, efficient and accurate way.

**Estimated Crop**

**Field Performance**

The platform allows you to visualize the growth curve of the berry in millimeters according to the estimated harvest date.

 **Climatic Conditions**
 
 Another section you can find in this interface is the weather conditions of the field. For example, it predicts the temperature in our area, gives us the wind speed, the humidity in percentage depending on the date, the ultraviolet index, the solar radiation and also gives us the precipitation measurement of the water fall in the place.

 ## Iterative Crop Maps
**Multispectral Images**

The interface features crop maps and interactive graphics to help identify real-time data more easily. 
We can visualize multispectral images showing the Normalized Moisture Difference Index.
